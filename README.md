# Rowdy Hacks 20203 game project
This is a C game where you engage as a rogue and enter through dungeons slaying enemies and collecting gold. In this game you have limited health to take on many monsters scattered throughout a dungeon. If you're low on health, make sure to find a nearby health pad marked 'h' to get a quick health boost. Engage enemies by walking into them and attack but make sure not to die.

## Controls:
UP:   W [enter]\
Left:     A [enter]\
Down:   S [enter]\
Right:  D [enter]

## Goal:
Slay all the enemies in the dungeon and collect as much loot as possible!
